## Assignment One

Welcome to the world of 3D. This is the first game we are creating in the second semester of the Game Development course for University High School of Indiana.

This game will be added to throughout the semester, so make sure to always keep a copy of it backed up somewhere.

By the end of the semester, you will have a multiplayer game where people will race against each other and the clock to reach the end of a game level. Along the way you will gain special abilities from power ups that you can use to thwart the other players advancement through the level.

Game data is not persistent from session to session, but can carry over from match to match (all in the same session).

## Learning Objectives
- We will start with what it is like to conceptualize objects in a 3d spatial environment.
- Creating and working with objects in 3D space.
- Enabling your game to be player by multiple people at the same time through networking.
